We were able to access the protected class memebers since they were part of the same directory,
files part of the same directory are considered to be part of the same package.
If we were to put them in seperate folders and try to do the same opertaion we would have a conflict and we would not be able to access the protected memebers.

Files and classes part of the same package have access to protected members.
